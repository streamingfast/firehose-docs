# Overview

### Firehose Setup Overview

#### Setup Overview in Detail

Setting up and integrating the Firehose system can be accomplished in the following ways.

### Use Firehose with a supported blockchain

#### Firehose Supported Blockchains in Detail

Firehose can be set up for blockchains that have already been instrumented by StreamingFast. Use this path if the target blockchain has already been decided upon and an instrumented codebase is available. StreamingFast currently supports Ethereum, NEAR, Solana, and Cosmos.

### Set up Firehose for a new blockchain

#### New Blockchains & Firehose

New blockchains can also be instrumented to feed the Firehose system with the necessary data. The Firehose-ACME demo application, custom Google Protocol Buffs, and instrumenting a node are the steps required for using Firehose with new blockchains.
