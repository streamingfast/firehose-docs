# Resources

_--- DEV NOTE ---_

_There are two options for this page._&#x20;

1. _Build out an updated and more full list of links required for Firehose and related StreamingFast products._
2. _Remove the page because most of the links here are within the documentation already. Over time if/when links/resources change and updates to the StreamingFast suite are made it could become time-consuming to keep the info here current and accurate. The links within the documentation and the links here could potentially need to be updated._
