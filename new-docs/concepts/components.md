# Components

The Firehose system is comprised of several key components including the Extractor also called Mindreader, Merger, Relayer, and Firehose gRPC Server.&#x20;

The Firehose components work together in symphony to provide blockchain data from nodes to consumers through the gRPC Server.

### Extractor (Mindreader)

The Extractor component processes utilize the [node-manager](https://github.com/streamingfast/node-manager) library to run a blockchain node instance as a sub-process. The Extractor reads the data being generated by the process.

The data read by the Extractor component will feed all data sources in the Firehose system.

Extractor nodes can be considered simple, full nodes. Extractor nodes do not have archiving enabled or any additional caveats.&#x20;

Extractor nodes can be booted in the same fashion as a full node, using the same backup strategy.

When Firehose is enabled the Extractor will produce substantial amounts of data.

The Extractor component is often referred to as the Mindreader. This nickname stems from deepmind instrumentation.

**High Availability**

Use multiple Extractor components to ensure blocks always flow through the target system being designed.

`Firehose` is designed to deduplicate any `Extractor` data produced that would be identical (when two `Extractor` instances execute the same block), and also to aggregate any forked blocks that would be seen by one `Extractor`, and not by another one.

See the [merger](components.md#merger) for details.

By adding more `Extractor`s, and dispersing them geographically, they end up racing to push blocks to the `Relayer`, increasing performance of the overall system.

### Merger

The `Merger` collects _one-block files_ written by one or more `Extractor`s, into a _one-block object store_, and merges them to produce _merged blocks files_ (a.k.a 100-blocks files).

One core feature of the `Merger` is the capacity to merge all forks visited by any backing `Extractor` node.

The merged block files are produced once the whole 100 blocks are collected, and after we're relatively sure no more forks will occur (`bstream`'s _ForkableHandler_ supports seeing fork data in future merged blocks files anyway).

**Detailed Behavior**

* On boot, without a `merged-seen.gob` file, it finds the last merged-block on storage and starts at the next bundle.
* On boot, with `merged-seen.gob` file, the merger will try to start where it left off.
* It gathers one-block-files and puts them together inside a bundle
  * The bundle is written when the first block of the next bundle is older than 25 seconds.
  * The bundle is written when it contains at least one fully-linked segment of 100 blocks.
* The merger keeps a list of all seen (merged) blocks in the last `{merger-max-fixable-fork}`
  * "seen" blocks are blocks that we have either merged ourselves, or discovered by loading a bundle merged by someone else (another `Extractor`)
* The merger will delete one-blocks:
  * That are older than `{merger-max-fixable-fork}`
  * That have already been seen (merged), as recorded by the `merged-seen.gob` file
* If the merger cannot complete a bundle (missing blocks, or hole...) it looks at the destination storage to see if the merged block already exists. If it does, it loads the blocks in there to fill its seen-blocks cache and continues to next bundle.
* Any one-block-file that was not included in previous bundle will be included in next ones. (ex: bundle 500 might include block 429)
  * Blocks older than `{merger-max-fixable-fork}` will, instead, be deleted.

**High Availability**

This component is needed when you want highly available `Extractor` nodes. You only need one of these, because the whole system can survive downtime from the merger, and it only produces files from time to time anyway.

Systems in need of blocks, when they start, will usually connect to `Relayer`s, get real-time blocks and go back to merged block files only when the `Relayer` can't satisfy the range. If `Relayer`s provide 200-300 blocks in RAM, then you have that time for the `Merger` to be down, to sustain _restarts_ from other components.

Once the other components are live, in general, they won't read from merged block files.

### Relayer

**Description**

The `Relayer` serves executed block data to most other components.

It feeds from all `Extractor` nodes available (in order to get a complete view of all possible forks). Its role is to fan-out that block information.

The `Relayer` serves its block data through a streaming gRPC interface called `BlockStream::Blocks` ([defined here](https://github.com/streamingfast/proto/blob/develop/sf/bstream/v1/bstream.proto)). It is the _same_ interface that `Extractor` exposes to the `Relayer`s.

**High Availability**

`Relayer`s feed from all of the `Extractor` nodes, to get a complete view of all possible forks.

### Firehose gRPC Server

**Description**

`Firehose` consumes merged blocks for historical requests from the data storage location directly, and live blocks from the `Relayer` (itself connected to one or more `Extractor` instances) for live blocks.

**High Availability**

`Firehose`s can be horizontally scaled and will be limited by the throughput of the network between them and clients, as well as them as the `Relayer`s.

`Firehose`s can connect to a subset, or all of the `Relayer`s.

Having `Firehose`s connect to all `Relayer`s increases the likelihood of seeing all forks, and being able to navigate those forks for clients that request them while they are still in memory. All forks do end up in the merged blocks, so in the worst case, navigation of forks is delayed when forked blocks do not make it to all `Firehose`s.
