# Concepts & Architecture Overview

StreamingFast Firehose is comprised of many different parts and pieces. Gaining an understanding of the core Firehose concepts and technical architecture will assist in fully comprehending the product.

One important thing to understand is the Firehose system will run on StreamingFast infrastructure in most cases.&#x20;

Developers will typically use Firehose through StreamingFast Substreams technology. StreamingFast has implemented the instrumentation on internal StreamingFast nodes for several popular blockchains including Ethereum, NEAR, Solana, and a few others.&#x20;

Companies and individuals looking to take advantage of Substreams using Firehose will need to register for an authentication key and also provide ProtoBuff data model representations for data they're wishing to capture from a blockchain.
