{{< alert type="important" >}}
Make sure you have a solid understanding of the [Firehose Concepts & Architecture.]({{< ref "/operate/concepts" >}}).

Review the [Principles & Approach documentation]({{< ref "/operate/concepts/principles" >}}) to align your integration with the goals of Firehose.
{{< /alert >}}


This document walks you through a brand new Firehose integration.

## Clone the ACME repo

The ACME repo is the sample repository that you'll base yourself on for your new integration.

```
git clone git@github.com:streamingfast/firehose-acme
```

Next steps will happen within that repository.

## Run it

To start your work, make sure you can run the `fireacme` binary, and have it obtain data from your instrumented blockchain node.

```
go install -v ./cmd/fireacme
```

This will install the `fireacme` binary in your `GOPATH`, which is normally `~/go/bin`. **Make sure this path is in your `PATH` before continuing.**



## Test with the dummy chain

Modify `devel/standard/standard.yaml` to point to the dummy chain implementation. Install it from https://github.com/streamingfast/dummy-blockchain


## Integrate your chain

Modify `devel/standard/standard.yaml` and change the `start.flags.mindreader-node-path` flag to point to your blockchain node's binary. Learn more about those parameters in the [Operator's manual]({{#< ref "/operate/running-the-node" >#}}).

Modify `devel/standard/start.sh` to

Run it with:


## Define types

Go to the `proto` directory, and modify `sf/acme/type/v1/type.proto` to match your chain's types.  More details in [specs for chain's protobuf model definitions](./protobuf-defs)


## Modify the Ingestor's `Read()`

Inside `codec`, is a file called `reader.go`. This file is the boundary between your process and the firehose's ingestion process.

Read the source of the `ConsoleReader` and make sure you understand how it works. This will be the bulk of your integration work.

Do X, Y, Z



## Make sure data is produced

As you iterate, check that files are produced under `xyz` directory.



## Rename everything

Pick two names, the long form and short form for your chain, following the [naming conventions](./names).

For example:

* `arweave` and `arw`

Then finalize the rename:

* Rename `cmd/fireacme` -> `cmd/firearw` (short form)
* Search and replace `fireacme` => `firearw` (short form)
* Do massive search and replace from: `acme` => `arweave` (long form)
