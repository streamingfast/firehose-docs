# Firehose Setup

Getting Firehose up and running can be accomplished in a few different ways.&#x20;

#### Basic Firehose with Fake Data App

The Firehose system can be set up with an application designed to replicate an actual instrumented blockchain node. Use this path if you don't have the computational power to run a full blockchain node.

#### Use Firehose with a supported blockchain

Alternatively, Firehose can be set up and integrated for blockchains that have already been instrumented by StreamingFast. Use this path if you're familiar with blockchain node setup, installation, and operation.

#### Use Firehose with an unsupported blockchain

Unsupported blockchains can also be instrumented to feed the Firehose system with the necessary data.&#x20;
