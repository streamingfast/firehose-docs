# Supported Blockchains

Supported blockchains that can be integrated immediately with Firehose include Ethereum, NEAR, Solana, and Cosmos.

It's important to keep in mind that all of the hardware required for the target blockchain node is required for working with the Firehose system. Each blockchain has specific requirements for running a node.&#x20;

The blockchain-specific node requirements for each can be found by visiting the following websites.

[Run a node - Ethereum.org ](https://ethereum.org/en/run-a-node/)

[Run a Node on Linux and MacOS - NEAR Nodes](https://near-nodes.io/validator/running-a-node)

[Running a Validator - Solana Docs](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator)

[Running a Node - Cosmos SDK Documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/run-node/run-node.html)

Internet connection availability and speed are other factors that need to be accounted for to set up the node and Firehose system.

_Would it make sense to move the Sync pages for the instrumented blockchains as subpages under Supported Blockchains?_
