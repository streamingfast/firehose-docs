# Integration

Top-level tasks for setup and integration include:

* fully understanding the Firehose concepts and architecture,
* determining the target blockchain to use with the Firehose system,
* and choosing the best setup path to get started.

Setting up and integrating the Firehose system can be accomplished in a few different ways.

1. Set up and run the Firehose Demo
2. Use Firehose with a supported blockchain
3. Use Firehose with an unsupported blockchain

_--- DEV NOTE ---_

_Does it make sense to have this page and the Firehose Setup page? Aren't they basically the same thing? Integration really only means something to someone who already understands Firehose. It might make sense to leave the top-level page titled Firehose Setup and then within the subpages introduce "integration." The Concepts & Architecture might need slight updates as well. For someone coming into StreamingFast without a lot of context or knowledge of the terminology of the product "integration" as a top-level page isn't completely clear._&#x20;
