# Prerequisites

#### Prerequisites

Software Developers and Systems Administrators should have an understanding of Linux operating systems, shell scripting, using the command line, computer programming, web-based application development, Git, compiling C and Go code, and blockchain technologies and terminology.

StreamingFast provides a Firehose Demo that is runnable without a fully functional blockchain node.&#x20;

Full Firehose systems require a functional and operating blockchain node. Each blockchain has specific hardware and internet connection requirements. Refer to the specific vendor's documentation for the target blockchain. Additional information is provided in the Integration section of the Firehose documentation.
