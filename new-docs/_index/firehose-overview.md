# Firehose Overview

Firehose is a core component of StreamingFast’s suite of open-source blockchain data software development products.

Firehose was created by StreamingFast to provide a files-based and streaming-first approach to processing blockchain data. Firehose is made available as part of the StreamingFast software suite.

The StreamingFast software suite enables low-latency processing of blockchain data in real-time in the form of binary data streams. The StreamingFast suite also presents the ability to execute massive operations on historical blockchain data, in an extremely parallelized manner.

Firehose was created to increase the speed and performance of blockchain data extraction from problems encountered in deployed real-world applications.&#x20;

Firehose provides a single source of truth for developers looking to utilize blockchain data for their blockchain application development efforts. Part of the motivation behind creating Firehose was to remove the need for ad-hoc RPC calls to protocol nodes while populating data stores.

The Firehose instrumentation service is added to a node for efficient capture and simple storage of blockchain data. Firehose extracts, transforms and saves blockchain data in a highly performant file-based strategy. Blockchain developers can access data extracted by Firehose through binary data streams.

Firehose is intended to stand as a replacement for The Graph’s original blockchain data extraction layer. [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing protocol used for the organization of blockchain data.

To get started with Firehose the first step is to learn about its core concepts and technical architecture.&#x20;

The next step is to find the documentation for the specific blockchain for the node you are working with.&#x20;

Additional blockchain-specific documentation is provided to assist with the installation, setup, configuration and operation of Firehose.
