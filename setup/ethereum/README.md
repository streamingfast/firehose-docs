## Firehose Ethereum Setup

Setting up Firehose for Ethereum is a straightforward process that uses StreamingFast's pre-instrumented code solution.

The primary tasks for running a Firehose instrumented node are

* install all dependencies,
* deploy the instances,
* reprocess history,
* and starting streaming data.
