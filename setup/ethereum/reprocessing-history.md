# Reprocessing history

_**Coming soon**_

information on how to do historical reprocessing. At least the processes, CLI flags involved, configuration not to miss, etc. Sort of snapshots required on disk. How the node behaves on reboots, how to position a blockchain to start at a particular height. How to invoke the `firehose-acme` binary to launch a segment of processing.
