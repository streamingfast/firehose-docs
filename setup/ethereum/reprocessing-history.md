# Reprocessing history

## **Coming soon**

information on how to do historical reprocessing. At least the processes, CLI flags involved, configuration not to miss, etc.&#x20;

Snapshots required on disk. How the node behaves on reboots, how to position a blockchain to start at a particular height. How to invoke the `firehose-acme` binary to launch a segment of processing.
