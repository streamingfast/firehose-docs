# Cosmos



Setting up Firehose for Ethereum is a straightforward process that uses StreamingFast's pre-instrumented code solution.\


The primary tasks for running a Firehose instrumented node are&#x20;

* install all dependencies,&#x20;
* deploy the instances,
* reprocess history,&#x20;
* and starting streaming data.
