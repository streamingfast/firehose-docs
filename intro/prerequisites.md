# Prerequisites

We expect Software Developers and Systems Administrators using Firehose to have good knowledge of standard tools like [shell scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell\_script) and [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line\_interface).

## Technologies Used

* [Golang](https://go.dev/)
* [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
* [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)
* [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) technologies and terminology

## Requirements

Full Firehose spins up a full node blockchain node (an [Ethereum full node](https://ethereum.org/en/run-a-node/) on Ethereum, a [NEAR full node](https://near-nodes.io/rpc) on NEAR, etc.)&#x20;

Each blockchain has specific hardware and internet connection requirements. Refer to the specific vendor's documentation for the target blockchain.&#x20;
