# Firehose

## Welcome to Firehose Docs

Firehose is a blockchain data streaming technology developed by StreamingFast working with [The Graph Foundation](https://thegraph.com/). The product provides previously unseen capabilities and speeds for indexing such data using a files-based and streaming-first approach.

This documentation serves as the main resource for understanding and working with StreamingFast Firehose.

### Where to Start

[Firehose Overview](intro/firehose-overview.md) is a great place to begin learning about the overall scope, vision, and capabilities of Firehose.

The [Concepts & Architecture](architecture/components/) provides an in-depth look at the decisions that drove the development team's efforts while designing Firehose.

Full source code is available in the [official Firehose Github repository](https://github.com/streamingfast/firehose).

Learn about Firehose in these short videos and understand how to run a Firehose as an Operator.
