# Firehose

## Welcome to Firehose Docs

Firehose is a new technology developed by StreamingFast working with [The Graph Foundation](https://thegraph.com/). The product provides previously unseen capabilities and speeds for indexing blockchain data using a files-based and streaming-first approach.

This documentation serves as the main resource for understanding and working with StreamingFast Firehose.

### Where to Start

[Firehose Overview](https://firehose.streamingfast.io/introduction/firehose-overview) is a great place to begin learning about the overall scope, vision, and capabilities of Firehose.

The [Concepts & Architecture](https://firehose.streamingfast.io/concepts-and-architeceture/components) provides an in-depth look at the decisions that drove the development team's efforts while designing Firehose.

Full source code is available in the [official Firehose Github repository](https://github.com/streamingfast/firehose).
