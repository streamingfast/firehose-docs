# Substreams

## Firehose vs Substreams

Substreams consumes Firehose block stream data and provides a mechanism for developers to harness very targeted types of block data through custom protobuf schemas.

So, while there is some overlap between the Firehose and Substreams, they aren't the same thing.  They work together, in conjunction to provide efficient blockchain data streaming.

The installation and operation procedures are both different as well. The main thing to remember is Firehose and Substreams work together in harmony to provide exceptionally fast access to blockchain data for DApps and Web3 development efforts.
