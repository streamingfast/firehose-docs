# Overview

## Firehose Setup Overview

Setting up and integrating Firehose can be accomplished in the following ways as outlined below.

## Use Firehose with a supported blockchain

### Firehose-Supported Blockchains in Detail

Firehose can be set up for blockchains that have already been instrumented by StreamingFast. Use this path if the target blockchain has already been decided upon and an instrumented codebase is available. StreamingFast currently supports Ethereum, NEAR, Solana, and Cosmos.

## Set up Firehose for a new blockchain

### New Blockchains & Firehose in Detail

New blockchains can also be instrumented to feed Firehose with its necessary data. The Firehose-Acme template, custom Google Protocol Buffs, and node instrumentation are all tasks required for setting up Firehose with blockchains that don't currently have an instrumented node client solution in place.
