# Why Integrate the Firehose

From a Layer 1 blockchain core development team's perspective, integrating Firehose into your chain brings you and your community the following benefits.

* Immediate support for [Substreams](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/), and its high-speed parallel processing engine.
* Immediate integration into the latest `graph-node` which can feed directly from Firehose.
* Immediate support for dozens of sinks (think loading to PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CDC replication, Kafka, Flink, writing to buckets for ingestion by BigQuery, AWS Redshift, Clickhouse, etc.).
* Activates a community of developers that already know how to index blockchain data, and are going to be happy to discover your blockchain’s data model and activity.

From a Layer 1’s users’ perspective, you’ll get the following benefits.

* The capability to quickly index and sift through your favorite blockchain’s history.
* Stream its output with low latency.
* Hook it to any data systems you have, trading bots, cross-chain bridges, databases.
* All of it in an extremely reliable way.
* Benefit from the anti-fragility brought by The Graph network.
