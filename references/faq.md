## **What is Firehose?**

Firehose is an extremely efficient blockchain data indexing solution. Rich data is extracted from blockchain nodes and saved to simple flat files providing capture and processing speeds previously thought to be impossible. Firehose is primarily written in the Go programming language and takes full advantage of the parallel computing aspects available. Firehose makes paramount improvements in the speed and performance of data availability for any blockchain.

## **What is Firehose for?**

Firehose is available for developers creating decentralized applications, creating blockchain data-related solutions, or wanting to capture data from non-Firehose instrumented blockchains.

Substreams and Firehose can be used together and typically are. The two complement each other in terms of the functionality they provide. Substreams uses blockchain data extracted and provided by Firehose. Firehose is responsible for extraction and provision and Substreams handles transforming and manipulating the data.
